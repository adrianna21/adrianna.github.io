                <p> No head, no arms, just boobs. Is she even human? Women are seen with these sets of eyes on a regular basis in our society. Yet another male gac painting, but it just seems sadder than it should be. Is it because there is no head? There is no identification of who this woman could really be other than the size of her breasts. Are women just breasts to the world? When will we be identified by more than the male gaze>

                <h2> and jesus cried. </h2>
                <p> My oldest piece, made in 2019 when I was just a sophomore in high school. I was still young but I understood where my priorities were at. I was tied to my religion because of my parents, the idea of speaking against it in any sort of way at the time terrified me. I felt hopeless when it came to speaking my mind out. Christianity is not the most open religion to homosexuality, at the time I was in question of my sexuality as I was just 14 and had a lot more to experience before deciding who or what I liked. I simply knew that I wanted to be an ally to the LGBTQ+ community, but what my mother had to say about such a thing terrified me. It wasn't until 2022 when I finally showed my mother this piece I made in November of 2019. I was scared of what she would think of not just the ideas behind the piece but my talent as an artist as well. I pictured my mom would also cry just like Jesus did. Cry in disappointment at who her daughter came to be. </p>

                <h2> i hate old people </h2>
                <p> The pain that is acquired through the more years we stay on this earth. So I say "I hate old people?" when just the idea of growing older is what is separating me and from my growing old loved ones. I hate that they are "old", and will have higher risks of getting ill and bringing pain and suffering to my environment. The thought of my grandma not being able to tell who I and my little brother are and asking for the "other two kids" she remembers from 10 years ago, not being able to recognize the present and still stuck in the past. I blame it all on those wrinkles she got. Yet, while I was in agony over lost memories that weren't even my own, my grandma still smiled like she did when she had to clean the house of the rich to bring food to the table or even when she couldn't remember what she said 5 minutes ago and repeated herself multiple times. She shined like no one else in the room. I love her so much. And yet, I still hate old people. </p>
