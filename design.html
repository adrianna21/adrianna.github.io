                <h2> Enviromental Crisis Poster </h2>
                <p> The purpose of my project is to illustrate and inform viewers on the damages that fast fashion causes on our planet every year and the dangers it brings with it. My poster visualizes an actual fast fashion shopping online app, but instead of having pretty ladies in dresses, it has images of children who have been forced into fast fashion child labor and wasted textiles by the companies. The message in my project is emphasized when it is represented in a source and format that people are more familiar with like a shopping app, rather than in a solid background. The background holds a deserted place full of trashed clothes that go far into the picture, symbolizing the number of textiles that end up in the trash due to fast fashion. At the bottom of the piece there is a weird smoke-like substance coming out of the phone screen and I hope to leave it up to the viewer’s subjectivity. Not everyone is the same. Sometimes less speaks louder than chunks of information. I was highly inspired by the piece by Barbara Kruger titled “I shop therefore I am” as the reader can give meaning to what they see and fit it into their life.</p>
